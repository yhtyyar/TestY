# TestY TMS
TestY is a Test Management System developed by [KNS Group LLC (YADRO)](https://yadro.com) since 2022 and 
published in 2023 as an open source project under AGPLv3 license.

<br />

## Introduction

**TestY is lightweight and uses following technologies and frameworks:**
* Django for backend
* ReactJS for frontend
* PostgreSQL &ndash; database server

*<u>Note: the list above contains not all but the key items only</u>*

**TestY is based on classic approaches of TMS:**
* All tests and related stuff separated into projects
* Test cases grouped by suites for any deep nesting
* Test Plans collect Test Cases as Tests and it can be parametrized
* A Test can have none, one or more results of test execution. For test cases based on steps every step has own status
* Statistics reports consider only recent results of a test plan

**TestY highlights:**
* Responsive and intuitive user interface
* Every key entity (Test Case, Test, Test Plan, Test Result) can be extended by custom attributes with following type: 
text, list, json
* Private projects for limited access of users
* History of test cases changes 
* Labels for test cases that allow to filter tests in test plans for getting of result slices
* Markdown editor for all text fields
* Comments for Test Cases, Test Results
* Charts and statistics for Tests estimates
* Installation includes 3 plugins: import from TestRail, import from Allure report and import from CSV files
* Public REST API for integrations
* Docker compose configuration distribution
* User interface localization for Russian language

## Getting started

### Requirements and preconditions

* Make sure that you have installed and running docker
  * For Windows users TestY requires running Docker Desktop with WSL2 support
* Installed OpenSSL library for your Linux (WSL2) installation to generate self signed SSL certificates 
* Download Testy release from official repository https://gitlab-pub.yadro.com/testy/testy/ and unzip it
   * The alternative way: clone the repository and then switch branch to chosed version by appropriate git command
* Remove docker images and volumes for previous TestY version (for **Development deployment** only) 

*<u>Note: if you are a newbie for TestY we suggest to use **Development deployment** to set up and run TestY locally 
to evaluate it: see the section below.</u>*    

 
### Production installation

1. Go to `{project_root}/nginx` directory and run `make_ssl.sh` to create self-signed ssl certificates.
    * Make sure that certificate files found in the directory
2. Copy `.env.template` to `.env`
3. Change the default values for variables in `.env`:
    * *SECRET_KEY* to your randomized string
    * *SUPERUSER_USERNAME* to your TestY Administrator login
    * *SUPERUSER_PASSWORD* to password of TestY Administrator    
    * *VITE_APP_API_ROOT* to TestY url: 
        * if plan to use FQDN as TestY hostname write it here (e.g. https://testy.mycompany.ru). 
        Otherwise, set IP address (e.g. https://100.99.88.77)
4. Run `sudo docker-compose up` (or `docker-compose up` under root user if sudo not supported 
nor installed in your system)
    * if you run under Windows/WSL2 and got the error like `entrypoint.sh: no such file or directory` 
    please check section **Known issues** below.  
5.  Wait until all TestY containers are up:
```
$ sudo docker ps --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}\t{{.Status}}'
NAMES             PORTS                                      STATUS
nginx             0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp   Up ## seconds
notifications                                                Up ## seconds
testy             0.0.0.0:8001->8000/tcp                     Up ## seconds
testy_celery                                                 Up ## seconds (healthy)
testy_pgbouncer   0.0.0.0:5436->5432/tcp                     Up ## seconds (healthy)
testy_db          0.0.0.0:5435->5432/tcp                     Up ## seconds (healthy)
testy_redis       0.0.0.0:6380->6379/tcp                     Up ## seconds (healthy)
```
*<u>Note: the container `testy-frontend` exits in a few seconds. It is the expected behavior. 
The container just builds the frontend as static JS file for nginx.</u>* 

6. Open URL defined in `.env` in *VITE_APP_API_ROOT* and log in by credentials 
defined in *SUPERUSER_USERNAME, SUPERUSER_PASSWORD*. 

   
#### Tips and trips

* Use regular (not self signed) SSL certificates
* Change *VOLUMES_PATH* for some other path than root, because every hard redeployment or local repository removing
   will delete your volumes information
* Do not use default settings for database
* Do not leave Administrator creds as it is
* Set server name for nginx configuration by *HOST_NAME* variable in `.env` file
* If you would like to `docker compose up` under regular (not root) user you need to add your 
user id as UID environment variable, by default we are using user with id 0 (which is root or default user)
* Change *VITE_APP_REPO_URL, VITE_APP_BUG_REPORT_URL* in `.env` to point out to your URLs if you forked TestY 
and made changes

### Development deployment

1. Copy `.env.template` to `.env`
2. Change the default values for variables in `.env`:
    * *VITE_APP_API_ROOT* to http://127.0.0.1
3. Run `sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up` (or `docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml` 
under root user if sudo not supported nor installed in your system)
    * if you run under Windows/WSL2 and got the error like `entrypoint.sh: no such file or directory` 
    please check section **Known issues** below.  
4. Wait until all TestY containers are up:
```
$ sudo docker ps --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}\t{{.Status}}'
NAMES             PORTS                    STATUS
nginx             0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp       Up ## seconds
notifications                              Up ## seconds
testy_celery                               Up ## seconds (healthy)
testy             0.0.0.0:8001->8000/tcp   Up ## seconds
testy_pgbouncer   0.0.0.0:5436->5432/tcp   Up ## seconds (healthy)
testy-frontend    0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp   Up ## seconds
testy_db          0.0.0.0:5435->5432/tcp   Up ## seconds (healthy)
testy_redis       0.0.0.0:6380->6379/tcp   Up ## seconds (healthy)
```
5. Open URL http://127.0.0.1 (not HTTPS!) and log in by credentials defined in `.env`: 
*SUPERUSER_USERNAME, SUPERUSER_PASSWORD*

### REST API
The API documentation provided by [Django REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) 
and can be found by URL: <br />
*VITE_APP_API_ROOT*/api/v2/swagger/

<br />

## Known issues

* Repository clone under Windows by git or in IDE may convert the line ending separator from LF to CRLF. 
It breaks `/backend/testy/scripts/entrypoint.sh` and `testy` container exits with non-obvious error 
`entrypoint.sh: no such file or directory`. Please revert CRLF back to LF.

## FAQ

<u>Question:</u> I open the page and try to log in but got *Login Failed* message<br />
<u>Answer:</u> Make sure that you open same URL as you defined for *VITE_APP_API_ROOT* in `.env` file. 

<u>Question:</u> What's about the load and limits?<br />
<u>Answer:</u> The system successfully tested for tens of thousands of cases and suites, hundreds of thousands of tests, 
millions test results, hundreds users. 

<u>Question:</u> What server or VM configuration you suggest for a production environment?<br />
<u>Answer:</u> 4 cores and 16GB RAM is minimal, 8 cores and 32GB RAM is recommended. 
Storage very depends on how many (and large) files you plan to store as attachments 
but anyway better to use SSD/NVMe storage type due to performance reasons.

<u>Question:</u> How to use LDAP authentication for TestY?<br />
<u>Answer:</u> Install `django-auth-ldap` and follow the manual 
[Django Authentication Using LDAP](https://django-auth-ldap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
